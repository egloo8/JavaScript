# JavaScript
As the time for the task is limited, I tried to do as much as possible in a few hours. I did not use CSS as I figured that it does not 
add any additional functionality, which is what I tried to focus on. I started with a basic HTML file, which has a few forms for a user 
to fill in. Using JavaScript I made the name fields disappear when a user selects anonymous and then I tried to implement the actual 
functionality of the form. Sadly, I did not manage to make it work properly, as my submitForms() function does not work. I tested it 
with console.log() function and it's clear that the function just does not run at all. I did not find a solution for this. 
Without being able to properly see my submit.html file working, as the form cannot actually be filled in, I tried to make a table and 
transfer information from the form to the table. I was not sure how to approach it, and what I did seems to be an incorrect way to do it,
but I did not find a better solution, but still wanted to try something. I was not sure if I can use strings the way I did to make cells
in a table. I am also aware that the time will show up us milliseconds since 1970, but I did not find a better Date function to show it.

While working on this test I felt like I did not have enough practical experience with JavaScript (I only did one small project using it 
in university last year) to complete it in a few hours, but as I was doing this test I definitely learnt more about it. I will try to 
do this task better in my own time and I would be grateful if you sent me any comments about what I did wrong.
